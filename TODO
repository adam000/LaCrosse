karlc@keckec.com and Skydiver have done some great work on getting the
'Epoch' value set so the weather server is not so chatty, and basically to keep
it happy, this has not been added.   Things like update rate have not been
added.

There is no reason why this cannot handle multiple weather stations in the cloud
or store weater data in local db.
